HOW TO COMPILE THE SOURCE CODE...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Compile the Exploding Marbles Source Code into a Working Game you will need:

•	Visual Basic 6.0 (ENTERPRISE OR Professional Edition) - Probably won't convert to later versions
•	The DirectX 8.1 or 9.0 SDK (Now Not Required)
•	A Version of Microsoft Windows Operating System (Windows XP or higher)
•	Commercial Version of SkinCrafter v2.8.1 or later (To Get This For Free Simply Install the Exploding Marbles Executable (Binary) From http://marbles.typosoftdev.com
•	THE REQUIRED DATA FILES, INSTALL THE GAME!

THE INSTALLATION WIZARD IS CREATED USING ADVANCED INSTALLER (COMMERCIAL) I CAN NOT PROVIDE THE INSTALLATION FILES…

Now once you have the required Tools, Open up the Exploding Marbles.vbp File
that’s in the project folder, in Visual Basic and Go to the File Menu and Choose "Make Exe"

If all goes well you should have a fully working executable called "Marbles.exe"
You should Save the Executable in the Game and Data Direc
